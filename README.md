A tech blog built using the MVC paradigm on a Node/Express/MySQL/Sequelize/Handlebars stack

## Description

This is a full-stack web log application that allows registered users to create, update and delete posts, and to attach comments to any posts on the site. The application uses a web interface built with Bootstrap, on an node.js express.js/MySQL/sequelize/handlebars backend. It uses connect-session-sequelize and express-session for user authentication. The application is deployed on Heroku and uses JawsDB for the MySQL database.

## Installation

### Setup on your machine

It is live on Heroku at the link below. To load it on your own machine for your own purposes, fork or copy the repository to your own machine. To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command in the terminal:
  
```bash
npm i
```

You must have MySQL installed on your machine or have access to a remote MySQL install.  Create a .env file in the root directory of the application.  Add the following lines to the .env file, replacing the values with your own, and other values as required for your MySQL installation:

```bash
DB_USER='your MySQL username'
DB_PASSWORD='your MySQL password'
DB_NAME='your custom database name'
```

### Creating the database

To create the database, open the terminal and navigate to the 'db' directory where you copied the repository. Open schema.sql in your preferred editor and update the database name to match the one you specified in the .env file.

Run the following command to open the MySQL shell:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Enter your MySQL password when prompted.  Then run the following command to create the database:

```bash
source schema.sql
```

### Creating the database tables and relationships

To create the tables and relationships prior to starting the application server, run the following command in the terminal from the root directory of the application:

```bash
npm run seed
```

The server will generate the tables on startup if they do not already exist anyway, so this step is optional.

### Starting the server

To start the server, run the following command in the terminal from the root directory of the application:

```bash
npm run start
```
